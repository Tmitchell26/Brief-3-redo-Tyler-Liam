Mouse Camera PseudoCode

1. create variables 
	- mouseLook (Vector2)
	- smoothV (vector2)
	- sensitivity = 5.0 (float)
	- smoothing = 2.0 (float)
	- player (GameObject)

2. add to start method 
	- player = this transform parent gameobject 

3. add to update method 
	- var mr = new vector2 input get axis (mouse x), input get axis (mouse y)
	- smoothv = math lerp (smoothv.x,md.x,1/smoothing)
	- smoothv = math lerp (smoothv.y,md.y,1/smoothing)
	- mouseLook += smoothv
	- transform local rotation = Quaternion angle axis (-mouselook.y,vector3.right)
	- player transform local rotation = Quaternion angle axis (mouseLook.x, player transform up)
